## What I'm Working On

### 🤖 Robotics & AI
Currently knee-deep in robotics, working on connecting maniskill with lerobot. Building systems that help people explore and share their ideas, whether that's robotics, math, or anything else.

### 🌱 Hydroponics & 3D Printing
Designing and printing vertical grow towers using FreeCAD and Python. Working on modular, stackable systems with precise water flow control and optimal plant spacing. The goal is to make high-efficiency growing systems that are both beautiful and functional.

### 🖥️ High-Performance Computing
Working with Slurm to manage computational resources for everything from robotics simulations to hydroponic system design. Building tools that make it easier to run complex simulations and process large datasets.

### ✍️ Technical Writing
Building a better system for technical content – not just another AI writing tool, but a system that helps organize scattered knowledge into coherent structures. Whether it's a tweet, a blog post, or a book, the goal is to help people maintain consistency and build on their ideas without losing the human element.

### 🖧 Infrastructure
Working on a hybrid setup that combines local development with executable books, cloud runners, and bare-metal hardware so experiments can scale from a laptop to the cluster with minimal friction.
