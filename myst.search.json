That‚Äôs of course a sophmoric understanding of physics, but that‚Äôs what I had to work with.\n\nI went full crank. Eventually I was saved by the grace of nuclear energy and communism pulling me back from the brink, but that‚Äôs to be expected when your trained SFT on sophmore level physics slop by scholars disconnected from the science.\n\nAnway I hunted everywhere for this equation. Thought it was the missing link. Where we zigged when we should have zagged. Oh well! I build AI agents now. That‚Äôs pretty freaking cool you have to admit.

Do not let the next equations fool you. The source of \\bold{E} fields are static charges and the source of \\bold{B} fields are current densities \\bold{J} AKA moving charges.\\nabla \\cdot \\bold{B} = 0\n\nEqn. \n\n(1.3) is known as Ampere‚Äôs Law and relates changing magnetic fields with respect to time with the curl of the electric field \\bold{E}, which is of course a differential relationship between the electric field and space.
