I didn't do much of anything this week outside of work, and even then I wasn't that busy at work. Not really sure what I've been doing to be honest. Weeks leading up to this week have been marked by goal after goal being accomplished. This week I just sort of existed.

I added an articles section because having a publicly facing journal is fine, but not every journal post is going to be an article.


Going through my posts it's obvious I'm right on the cusp of some very exciting stuff. I think I'm just tired honestly. I haven't been doing any real planning because I set some general goals for myself and I've sort of stuck with them. Maybe not every day, but I've not gone too long without working on

- the math book
- my robotics research
- hydroponics

I'm really ready to have a grow tower set up. I've got everything I need, just need to figure out a way to set these parts together reliably. I broke a couple of them during the photo shoot of putting them all together, so yeah. Not sure exactly *how* I want to do this.

I think I just need to go buy some sheet plywood and start measuring and cutting. Putting some tension on them on z-axis isn't going to help with the fact they can't really do any torque. Think I'm going to zip tie them to a strip of plywood or something to give them some torsional strength.

I'm a busy guy! On top of doing all of the above I'm not content unless I'm able to communicate what I'm doing with a beautiful website with ease, which I guess is my way of saying I spent a long time working on the infrastructure around the Scientific Computing book I'm working on. It's not the only book I want to put together.

The idea is I'd love to be able to just journal and write up my progress for the various projects I'm working on currently and have an AI assistant move the material where it needs to be in Books or Projects.

Yeah I need to put together a projects directory to show off my research. It might not be much to look at, but I am absolutely a scientist. I do experiments. I record results. I'm going to start sharing them on my website.

That's how these things work.
