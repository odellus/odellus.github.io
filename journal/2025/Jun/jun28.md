# Camera mounts

So I'm printing the parts I've been modifying this week. First up is the top piece of the [camera mount][overhead-camera]. I guess I'm printing out both camera mounts separately or something. I mean I know I want to use two cameras so the order isn't really that important.


First print turned out garbage but luckily I caught it in a reasonable amount of time that I didn't waste too much filament. 

This isn't the first part I've designed that I've printed out, but it's the first real remix I've ever done with FreeCAD of someone else's STL file. The other part I've printed out that I designed myself was the grow tower, which I have printed far, far more of than any other type(s) of prints combined.

Got this finished up today.

I didn't verify that my cameras would fit on these mounts and they're a little wide so I'm waiting for the cameras these mounts **were** designed for to arrive in the mail. They're only \$18 a camera so \$36 isn't too bad. I'm also probably going to put together a whole array of cameras for high resolution 3D scanning and reconstruction.

Now my datasets won't be ruined by bumping the table or moving the arm in position along the edge. Cameras are fixed with respect to the robot's base.



# Grow tower

I had to update the [grow tower][grow-tower] after some investigation and a lot of thought. The ropes can totally hold it together, but they need to be __inside__ the tower to give it the stability it needs. I'm also going to buy some rubber coating and apply it to the inside of each piece to make sure it's waterproof. Then I'm going to apply it to the outside when they're joined together to add needed strength and stability.

So now I have it figured out how I'm going to mount them (I'm going to hang them like before), I can get started in earnest on building the rack that's going to hold them. I should probably spend a bit on some plastic to lay down on the floor and up along the wall a bit so if there's every a spill I don't need to do anything wild to clean it up or worry about water damage.


# Progress!

Today was pretty relaxing all things considered. I probably should have eaten before 20:21, but I didn't. Oh well. I shouldn't have the problem of having to recreate my datasets because I bumped the table anymore. More importantly, I've settled on how I'm going to mount the towers.

Next up is designing the rack and the gutter for returning the water to the reservoir.
