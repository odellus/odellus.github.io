I think I'm already starting to find having a publicly facing journal/blog that I'm supposed to update regularly a bit tedious. I don't know, feels sort of Big Brother. Like I'm trying to get out in them podcasts.



I am not.

I talked all this shit about my projects and how I need to do XYZ to get lerobot-sim2real working and I don't even have the spit to connect the `so100`? Barely enough gumption to log in to the not work laptop?

I need to be designing camera stands to print and extruding objects in FreeCAD or sketchup if I can't fucking figure FreeCAD out.

I need to be sealing plywood with some form of hydrophobic solution. Or just basically laminate it. I've got to get the ball rolling on hydroponics. It's been too damn long. I miss the sound of water flowing through the towers. I miss growing things in an aquarium.
