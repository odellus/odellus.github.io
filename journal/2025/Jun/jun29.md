# Cleaning up

I really want to get one of those roombas. I had one in Vegas and it was nice. I've got almost everything off the floor in the dining room and kitchen, but there's still a lot of work to do in the rest of the house. I figured I might as well clean top to bottom and I've been going through all of my Akro Mil bins and organizing them, throwing away stuff I don't need. Putting similar things in plastic bags so I can consolidate stuff. I've got a label maker but they're plastic bags I can just write on the outside of them what they are.


I threw away a lot of stuff that had been accumulating in the central hall yesterday and bought a swiffer duster so I've been running around for the past couple of hours gathering all of the random bits of hardware I don't want to throw away but don't have any use for that seem to have gathered on all of the surfaces in the house into a bag so I can just have the "furniture hardware/allen wrench" bag and dust around here.

# Refinancing

I really need to refinance. I bought when mortgages were 7% and I've been waiting for Powell to cut every since. I could have bought a nice car with the money I've spent on my 7% mortgage vs a reasonable rate since I've moved it.


Any damn day now. Shit even 6.625% would give me a few hundred back versus what I'm paying now. I saw one that wanted to give me cash out and I was paying way less a month versus what I'm at and I don't know I need to start looking into it. Looking like everybody wants to do refinance at 6.75%. 

:::{danger}FUCK
> THIS SUCKS!!!

## Quit my bitching

Okay I'll refinance when it makes more sense for me to refinance and not through some nonsense offer that's going to screw me over because I didn't read the fine print. Anyway.

# Computational Developmental Systems Biology

Okay I've got this to review the state of the art in cell simulation and developmental biology so I don't tread water in computational systems biology when I know so much and have so much to offer. This needs to be the game I play. I need to be a world expert at this stuff, and after just a little while, a few tutorials here, an addition of something to the code there, and I will be! The point is to get started.

This would be a great

# Query:
> I want to create a framework for testing hypotheses in developmental biology using the known genetic regulatory networks and whatever kinds of diffusion coefficients and whatnot we can glean from single cell rna and snp studies the whole nine yards, histography with real time 3d cell imaging. I want to create a database for this kind of information surrounding the waddington landscape of the cells as they divide. I imagine there are several sources of information on cell atlases for developmental model organisms. I want to collect them into a place where they can be put through the paces of simulation and integration of real work -omic data from various sources, including mass scale lit review, to arrive as some ideas as to how organisms develop on a more granular level than we might currently understand.

> Does this make any sense? I eventually want to integrate AI assistants for expert feedback, but I need some kind of database of single cell omic studies that can connect with actual genetic regulatory network simulations of development, even if they're not full cell based. We need to investigate carefully cell simulation advances of computational synthetic biology

### 1. **Database Architecture Recommendations**

**Hybrid Approach: MongoDB + Neo4j**

| Component         | Purpose                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MongoDB**       | Store heterogeneous, evolving omics data (single-cell RNA, SNPs, imaging, metadata) | Flexible schema, high scalability, ideal for diverse and large-scale biological datasets [[1]](https://medium.com/@prem.shah_15628/deep-dive-mongodb-vs-neo4j-vs-rdbms-a-technical-analysis-for-complex-biological-networks-e704df639e24#:~:text=MongoDB%E2%80%99s%20document%2Doriented%20architecture%20has,capable%20of%20handling%20the) |
| **Neo4j**         | Model and query complex genetic regulatory networks and cell relationships | Efficient for deep, relationship-centric queries (e.g., pathway analysis, lineage tracing) [[2]](https://medium.com/@marcoscedenillabonet/full-data-science-project-part-3-storage-architecture-with-mongodb-and-neo4j-a8ce87a4535a#:~:text=The%20combination%20of%20MongoDB,dataset%20of%20scientific%20articles) |
| **Integration**   | Use both in tandem: MongoDB for raw/processed data, Neo4j for network/relationship queries | Hybrid solutions are common in bioinformatics for comprehensive analysis [[3]](https://arcinstitute.org/news/arc-virtual-cell-atlas-launch#:~:text=Arc%20Institute%20today%20launched,initial%20release%20of%20the)            |

:::{important}**Key Finding:**  
This hybrid architecture supports both flexible data storage and efficient network analysis, crucial for modeling the Waddington landscape and integrating multi-omic, spatial, and temporal data.

# Wow! That's amazing.
Okay so I definitely need to dive deeper into the [Arc Virtual Cell Atlas][scBaseCount] and their [paper][scbase-paper]. `scBaseCount` sounds like something I was planning on doing myself as part of the project specs so I might as well read about how they're doing it.


 [GRiNS][GRiNS] and the other simulation engines definitely look like something I should be reading about.

I created a project called [`epiwad`][you-epiwad] that the above walks through a very cursory first draft idea regarding the project. I have a lot of work to do just on reading the background material before I ever start putting together code. Many tutorials to follow. Honestly I'm putting all of this crap into books. They might just be shitty AI slop that I have some bot put together from the work I'm doing and the tutorials I'm going to reproduce in the interest of building on top of all the amazing work that's already been done and writing it up in an accessible way, but it will be something.
