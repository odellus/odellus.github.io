**Marx's drive**  
- Capital must keep expanding productive capacity because competition punishes any firm that stands still.  
- That expansion inevitably presses prices and profit rates downward unless demand (and wages) rise just as fast—which they rarely do.  
- Left on its own, the system tips into gluts, layoffs, and crisis.

**Veblen's brake**  
- Owners do not wait for prices to collapse; they pre-empt the glut.  
- They idle machines, stage "strategic" shortages, buy patents to shelve them, lobby for longer copyrights, wrap code in licences—anything that re-creates scarcity before abundance reaches the market.  
- Veblen calls this deliberate throttling of technical potential "sabotage."

:::::{hint}
**How the two logics interlock**  
- Expansion and sabotage are not rival explanations; they are sequential moves in the same game.  
  - When profits look safe, investment surges and capacity races ahead of demand.  
  - When that new capacity threatens to cheapen output too much, the owners pivot to sabotage to keep margins intact.  
- Crisis, therefore, is no longer a sudden glut; it is a chronic condition in which artificially scarce digital goods and services sit next to surplus productive power that could deliver them for pennies.

**Why this matters in the digital economy**  
- Software, data, and culture can be copied at near-zero cost, so the temptation to share is constant.  
- The countermeasure is ever-thicker walls: Digital Rights Management, subscription gates, cloud‐only access, patent pools, NDAs.  
- Profit flows less from making things than from policing the boundary between those who may and may not copy.

**The distributional upshot**  
- Earnings detach from effort; they cling to ownership of the gate.  
- Workers and users face stagnant wages and rising fees, while rents—royalties, licence income, capital gains—balloon.  
- The familiar demand shortfalls show up again, but now they are driven by exclusionary legal codes rather than by physical limits on what factories can churn out.

:::::{tip}
**What drops out when you see both halves together**  
- You stop waiting for a classic over-production crash; the crash has been replaced by permanent under-utilisation.  
- Politics shifts from "who gets the surplus created in the factory?" to "who sets the rules that decide what counts as private property in the first place?"  
- Resisting exploitation therefore means prying open the choke-points—challenging IP law, insisting on open standards, breaking platform monopolies—not just fighting for a bigger wage share.

Read Marx if you want to understand why capacity keeps overshooting; read Veblen to see why it almost never reaches us. Put them together and the pattern of today's rent-heavy, IP-fortified capitalism snaps into focus.
