**Subject: To All Cowards**

To all you cowards out there,

You're probably squawking about "immanentizing the eschaton" again because *someone* is making a perfectly good thing like typesetting accessible to everyone.

"Don't immanentize your own eschaton," they say. But that's just an excuse—another way of saying you fear change, progress, and anyone trying to make things better for you or yourself. You sit there in your little echo chambers, spouting buzzwords nobody understands because it helps you feel important, but the truth is simple: if typesetting becomes easier, more people can do it—and that's a good thing.

This is about leveling the field, making tools that were once only available at high-end publishing houses accessible everywhere. This revolution is coming for you _New York Times_.

As for "making the world better"—the horrors!—that’s exactly what we're enabling here. More voices, more clarity, and less reliance on gatekeepers who think they’re too good at something to share it with us mortals.

So don't fear *us*—don’t fear the immanentizing of anything unless you have a damn good reason for doing so (which I doubt you do). Because in this world, progress always wins against stagnation. And if you're standing in its way because you’re too scared to change? Then you’re just another coward.

Sincerely,

Humberto
